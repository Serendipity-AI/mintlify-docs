## What is this?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Agents love Markdown — humans don’t"
    icon="robot"
  >
    Markdown is easy for AI agents to work with, but not so great for humans. We help agents transform their output into beautiful PDFs for human consumption.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Built for agents, not end-users"
    icon="code"
  >
    L402 and MCP native API - pay per call with sats, no OAuth, API keys or rate-limits. Send markdown, get back a PDF. No subscriptions or hidden tiers.

## Example output

Here's the output of a markdown file converted to PDF format, showing cover page, table of contents and table support. Our engine is powered by LaTeX rather than HTML to PDF conversion as many other libraries and services use, which results in a much higher quality, print-ready output.
